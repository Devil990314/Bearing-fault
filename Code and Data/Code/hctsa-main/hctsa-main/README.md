_hctsa_ is a Matlab software package for running highly comparative time-series analysis.
It extracts thousands of time-series features from a collection of univariate time series and includes a range of tools for visualizing and analyzing the resulting time-series feature matrix, including:

1. Normalizing and clustering time-series data;
2. Producing low-dimensional representations of time-series data;
3. Identifying and interpreting discriminating features between different classes of time series; and
4. Fitting and evaluating multivariate classification models.

__Feel free to [email me](mailto:ben.d.fulcher@gmail.com) for advice on applications__ of _hctsa_ :nerd_face:

## Installation :arrow_down:

For users _familiar with git_ (recommended), please [make a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of the repo and then clone it to your local machine.
To update, after setting an upstream remote (`git remote add upstream git://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa.git`) you can use `git pull upstream main`.
To obtain the latest toolboxes (like the optimized _catch22_ faeture set) you should then run `git submodule update --init`.

Users _unfamiliar with git_ can instead download the repository by clicking the green "Code" button then "Download ZIP".

Once downloaded, you can install _hctsa_ by running the `install.m` script (see [docs](https://hctsa-users.gitbook.io/hctsa-manual) for details).

<!-- We recommend working outside of the repository so that incremental updates can be pulled from the upstream repository. -->

## Documentation and Wiki &#x1F4D6;

__Comprehensive documentation__ for _hctsa_, from getting started through to more advanced analyses is on [GitBook](https://hctsa-users.gitbook.io/hctsa-manual).

There is also alot of additional information on the [__wiki__](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/wiki/), including:

- :point_right: Information about alternative feature sets (including the much faster [catch22](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/catch22)), and information about other time-series packages available in R, python, and Julia.
- :wavy_dash: The accompanying time-series data archive for this project, [_CompEngine_](http://www.comp-engine.org).
- :floppy_disk: Downloadable _hctsa_ feature matrices from time-series datasets with example workflows.
- :computer: Resources for [distributing an _hctsa_ computation](https://github.com/benfulcher/distributed_hctsa) on a computing cluster.
- :closed_book: A [list of publications](https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa/wiki/Publications-using-hctsa) that have used _hctsa_ to address different research questions.
- :information_desk_person: Frequently asked questions about _hctsa_ and related feature-based time-series analyses.

### External packages and dependencies

Many features in _hctsa_ rely on external packages and Matlab toolboxes.
In the case that some of them are unavailable, _hctsa_ can still be used, but only a reduced set of time-series features will be computed.

_hctsa_ uses the following [Matlab Add-On Toolboxes](https://au.mathworks.com/products.html): Statistics and Machine Learning, Signal Processing, Curve Fitting, System Identification, Wavelet, and Econometrics.

The following external time-series analysis code packages are provided with the software (in the `Toolboxes` directory), and are used by our main feature-extraction algorithms to compute meaningful structural features from time series:
