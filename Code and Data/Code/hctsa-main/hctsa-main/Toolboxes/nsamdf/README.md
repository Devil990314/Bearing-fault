---

The main MATLAB function to be used for the computation of the nonlinearity measure is `nsamdf_nonlinear_measure.m`, which calls the other subroutines `NormedSingleCurveLengthWindowed.m` & `NormedSingleCurveLength.m`.

All necessary info to run the code is given within the comments in `nsamdf_nonlinear_measure.m`.

Please refer to and cite the paper below if you utilize this code in your work. All necessary info about the nonlinearity measure itself can be found in the paper:
